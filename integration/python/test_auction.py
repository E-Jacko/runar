"""
Auction integration test -- stateful contract.

Auction is a StatefulSmartContract with properties:
    - auctioneer: PubKey (readonly)
    - highestBidder: PubKey (mutable)
    - highestBid: bigint (mutable)
    - deadline: bigint (readonly)

Methods: bid(bidder, bidAmount), close(sig).
The SDK auto-computes Sig params when None is passed.
