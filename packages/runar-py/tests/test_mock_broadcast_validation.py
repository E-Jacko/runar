"""Testing-gap remediation Phase A5 (Python tier).

``MockProvider.broadcast`` is fail-CLOSED by default, in TWO layers:

1. **Structural / non-vacuity / value conservation — stdlib only, always on.**
   The payload must parse as a Bitcoin transaction, at least one spent outpoint
   must be known to the provider, and (when every input is known) the outputs
   must not exceed the inputs.
2. **Script execution** — every known input replayed through the upstream
   ``bsv-sdk`` ``Spend`` interpreter with full transaction context.

Two deliberate departures from the TypeScript reference
(``packages/runar-sdk/src/providers/mock.ts``):

1. **No vacuous pass.** TS accepts a transaction none of whose inputs it knows
   — it validates NOTHING and returns valid. Here that is an error.
2. **The optional dependency is handled explicitly, never silently.** Layer 2
   needs ``bsv-sdk``, which ``runar`` does not require at runtime. When it is
   absent the provider records ``script_vm_available: False`` in
   ``last_validation_report`` (so a skipped script check can never be mistaken
   for a passing one), layer 1 still runs, and **in CI (``$CI`` set) the
   provider raises ``BroadcastValidationUnavailable``** — CI must never lose
   the script layer. CI already installs it for this package
   (``.github/workflows/ci.yml``: ``pip install pytest slh-dsa bsv-sdk``), and
   ``pyproject.toml``'s ``dev`` extra now declares it.

   Consequence to state plainly: **outside CI, Python fund-path script
   validation is conditional on an optional dependency.** Layer 1 is
   unconditional; layer 2 is not.

# degradation is visible rather than reported as validated. This matches the
