/**
 * Deep-review finding C13: `call()`'s coin-selection for funding inputs runs
 * BEFORE the real (final) unlocking script is built — it sizes against a
 * PLACEHOLDER unlock (72-byte Sig stand-ins) plus a heuristic per-contract-
 * input overhead (`perContractInputOverhead`, see the comment above
 * `contractInputBytes` in `prepareCall`). Once the REAL unlock is known
 * (after `buildStatefulUnlock`), there is no re-selection pass.
 *
 * INVESTIGATION RESULT: under-selection of the FEE portion (not the VALUE
 * portion) IS reachable — see the `it()` below, which reproduces it with a
 * contract whose CURRENT (spent) locking script is far larger than its NEW
 * (continuation) locking script. The preimage's `scriptCode` embeds the
 * CURRENT script, but the sizing heuristic only has the NEW script's length
 * (`fundingLockLen`) to go on; a state field that shrinks a lot between
 * calls (e.g. a ByteString reset to '') defeats the "current ~= new size"
 * assumption the heuristic depends on.
 *
 * However, this can NEVER produce an invalid or fund-losing transaction:
 *   - `buildCallTransaction` (calling.ts) computes its fee/change from the
 *     REAL (final) unlocking-script bytes on every call, not the estimate
 *     used for coin-selection — so the built tx's own fee arithmetic is
 *     always internally correct for its own actual size.
 *   - Finding C3's fail-closed guard (`totalInput < contractOutputSats`
 *     throws) guarantees inputs always cover at least the VALUE of the
 *     outputs, so `actualFee = totalInput - totalOutput` can never go
 *     negative — the worst case an under-estimate can produce is a LOW or
 *     ZERO fee, never an overspend.
 *   - A zero-fee "exact cover" call is already an intentional, tested SDK
 *     behaviour (issue #116 / `issue-116-zero-change.test.ts`), so this
 *     isn't a new safety hole — it's the same pre-existing floor, just
 *     reachable through a different trigger (script-size mismatch instead
 *     of "no funding UTXOs available").
 *
 * Conclusion: C13 does NOT need a re-selection loop. This test locks the
 * safety invariant instead (never negative/overspending, never throws
 * unexpectedly for a value-sufficient call) — matching the review's own
 * suggested resolution for the "can only ever overestimate" case, with the
 * caveat that the estimate can in fact undershoot the FEE specifically
 * (documented above), not just overshoot it.
