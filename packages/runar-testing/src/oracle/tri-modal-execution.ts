/**
 * Tri-modal source-vs-script differential-execution oracle (issue #124).
 *
 * Extends the bi-modal {@link runDifferentialExecution} (ANF `RunarInterpreter`
 * vs. `ScriptVM`) with a strict, full-consensus `Spend.validate()` leg:
 *
 *   1. interpreter — the ANF `RunarInterpreter` (source semantics, our code).
 *   2. ScriptVM   — the upstream `@bsv/sdk` `Spend` engine driven opcode by
 *                   opcode, with `success` = "no evaluation error and a truthy
 *                   top of stack" and the consensus wrappers switched off (see
 *                   `vm/script-vm.ts`).
 *   3. Spend      — the SAME upstream engine via `Spend.validate()`, which adds
 *                   the consensus **clean-stack** rule (exactly one truthy item
 *                   must remain), the **push-only unlocking** rule, and
 *                   **minimal-push** encoding.
 *
 * NOTE ON INDEPENDENCE: legs (2) and (3) are now the same third-party engine,
 * so they are no longer independent implementations — that changed when
 * `ScriptVM` stopped being a hand-rolled interpreter and became a wrapper around
 * `Spend`. What leg (3) still adds over leg (2) is the consensus script-SHAPE
 * rules, so a (2) accept / (3) reject disagreement means the compiled script
 * evaluates fine but is not a valid spend on the network. Genuine engine
 * independence lives in leg (1), the ANF interpreter — a separate
 * implementation of the SOURCE semantics.
 *
 * Scope matches the bi-modal oracle: STATELESS, non-crypto contracts (no
 * `checkSig`, no sighash, no state continuation). For those, `Spend` never needs
 * a real transaction context, so we drive it with a synthetic single-input
 * spend built directly from the compiled locking script + the generated witness.
