# Per-fixture spend witnesses (TS-GAP-004)

Each `<fixture>.json` declares concrete spend attempts for the differential
execution oracle (`packages/runar-testing/src/oracle/differential-execution.ts`).
The oracle compiles the fixture to its **fold-ON deployed bytes**, runs the
declared spend through the ANF interpreter (source semantics) *and* through the
`@bsv/sdk`-backed `ScriptVM` (script semantics), and asserts both engines agree
on accept/reject — catching a codegen bug downstream of ANF lowering where the
compiled script diverges from the interpreter's independent read of the same
source semantics. Every non-crypto conformance fixture SHOULD have one.

**This does NOT prove a correct post-spend state**, and it does NOT mean a bug
shared by all seven compilers is always caught (testing-gap remediation Phase
B / TG-008, see the docstring in `differential-execution.ts` for the full
argument): the oracle compares VERDICTS ONLY. The two engines share just
parse/validate/typecheck — the interpreter reads the parsed AST directly, and
ANF lowering sits downstream of that, so it is NOT shared with the
interpreter. This oracle CAN disagree with, and catch, a miscompile in ANF
lowering / stack-lower / emit, but ONLY when the bug flips accept/reject. A
miscompile that leaves the script acceptable while committing the WRONG
continuation state (the PALMER-1 class — branch-merged locals producing a
wrong-but-self-consistent continuation that both engines happily "accept") is
invisible to a verdict-only comparison, and this oracle reports `agrees: true`
while the state is wrong. The independent check for that failure mode is the
hand-authored `expectedState` pin on stateful accepts under `real-crypto/`
below (audit #4), not this oracle's agreement.

Schema:

    {
      "fixture": "arithmetic",
      "constructorArgs": { "target": "27n" },
      "spends": [
        { "method": "verify", "args": ["3n", "7n"], "expect": "accept",
          "note": "10 + (-4) + 21 + 0 = 27" },
        { "method": "verify", "args": ["3n", "6n"], "expect": "reject",
          "note": "near-miss: result 24 != target 27" }
      ]
    }

- `fixture` — the directory name under `conformance/tests/`. The `.runar.ts`
  source is resolved from that fixture's `source.json` (`sources[".runar.ts"]`).
- `args` and `constructorArgs` use the trailing-`n` convention for bigints
  (`"27n"`, `"-4n"`), `true`/`false` for booleans, and `"0x…"` for byte strings.
- `method` — a `public` method of the contract (a spending entry point). For a
  contract with more than one public method, the oracle appends the compiled
  method-selector index automatically; witness authors only list the method's
  own args.
- Every fixture MUST have ≥1 `accept` and ≥1 `reject` (near-miss) spend, ENFORCED
  in code by `coverage-claims.test.ts` — not just documented here. A few
  contracts have only tautological asserts (`x >= 0 || x < 0`) or are
  anyone-can-spend, so no rejecting witness exists; those set a top-level
  `"acceptOnly": true` field (see `bitwise-ops.json` / `shift-ops.json`) as an
  explicit, machine-checked opt-out — a silently absent reject spend fails the
  gate. `coverage-claims.test.ts` also flags a spec that sets `acceptOnly` but
  actually has a reject spend (a stale opt-out).

## Real-crypto execution (`real-crypto/`) — post-mortem remediation #1

The plain differential oracle runs on the in-process `ScriptVM`, which wraps
`@bsv/sdk`'s production `Spend` — its `OP_CHECKSIG` / `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` are
REAL secp256k1, there is no mock `checkSigCallback` (see root `CLAUDE.md` §
"Off-chain Script VM"). Its limitation is the TX CONTEXT, not the crypto: it
runs against a synthetic, fixed transaction (null outpoint, no outputs), so no
witness it is handed carries a signature over a real spending transaction, and
it cannot exercise a state-continuation preimage at all. Every fixture needing
a signature or a tx-context preimage was therefore routed OUT into the
coverage ledger (`coverage-ledger.json`) and got **no real execution** — the
exact blind spot behind BUG-100 / #99 / #100 / #44 (all seven tiers agreed on
bytes nobody ever ran with real crypto).

`real-crypto/<fixture>.json` closes that gap. Each spec is EXECUTED by
`real-crypto-execution.test.ts` through `@bsv/sdk`'s production `Spend`
interpreter — real secp256k1, real BIP-143 sighash, real `OP_CHECKSIG` /
`OP_CHECKMULTISIG` / `OP_CODESEPARATOR` / `checkPreimage`. Two kinds:

- **`stateless-signed`** — a stateless `SmartContract`. `$sig` args are filled
  with a real DER signature over the real single-input sighash
  (`runStatelessSigned` in `runar-testing`). The accept path is additionally
  cross-checked against the ANF interpreter (source-vs-script agreement); the
  interpreter's `checkSig` does REAL ECDSA over a fixed `TEST_MESSAGE`, so it is
  fed each key's precomputed `testSig`. (`checkMultiSig` is unimplemented in the
  interpreter, so multisig fixtures set `checkInterpreter: false`.)
- **`stateful`** — a `StatefulSmartContract` driven deploy→call through the SDK
  (`RunarContract` + a real `LocalSigner`) and re-validated on `Spend`
  (`runStatefulSpend`). This exercises the real auto-injected `checkPreimage`
  on-chain state binding (BUG-100) plus any user `checkSig`.

Each fixture carries ≥1 accept and ≥1 reject/near-miss, ENFORCED in code by
`coverage-claims.test.ts` (same `acceptOnly` opt-out convention as above). A
near-miss is a wrong key, a wrong signer (`owner` ≠ the call signer), or a
**tampered continuation output** (`tamperOutput: true` — corrupts output 0 so
the recomputed sighash no longer matches the on-stack preimage; the exact
BUG-100 property). Because the interpreter models crypto with real-but-fixed
`TEST_MESSAGE` checks it cannot model an arbitrary tx-context rejection, so a
crypto near-miss is a script-only rejection flagged `cryptoNearMiss: true`.

Placeholders resolve against `runar-testing`'s deterministic `TEST_KEYS`:
`{"$pubkey":"alice"}`, `{"$pkh":"alice"}` (ctor + args), `{"$sig":"alice"}`
(a real signature slot). Scalars use the trailing-`n` bigint convention, bare
hex for byte payloads, `true`/`false`, and `null` for an SDK-auto-signed Sig.
`satoshis` sets a continuation output amount that must match a method's
explicit `addOutput(<sats>, …)`; `lockTime` threads `nLockTime` for
`extractLocktime` / `currentBlockHeight` introspection.

## Exemptions — every fixture is witnessed, executed, OR in the coverage ledger

`completeness.test.ts` fails CI if any `conformance/tests/<fixture>` is neither
witnessed here, executed in `real-crypto/`, nor listed in **`coverage-ledger.json`**
with a `coveredBy` claim that is NOT `"UNCOVERED"` (and fails if
a `real-crypto/` fixture is ALSO still listed in the ledger — a stale over-claim
guard).

`coverage-ledger.json` is the SINGLE ledger of fixtures the plain differential
oracle does not execute. (It replaces the former `crypto-exempt.json` +
`harness-inapplicable.json` pair, which were the same mechanism read by the same
tests and differed only in that the second carried a `cause` discriminator.)
Each entry is `{fixture, cause, reason, coveredBy}`; the `cause` field is a
closed vocabulary, enforced by `coverage-claims.test.ts`:

- **`crypto-witness-infeasible`** — the spend needs a REAL cryptographic
  witness (ECDSA/Schnorr checkSig, secp256k1 / NIST-P EC, SHA-256 / BLAKE3 /
  RIPEMD / Merkle hash-preimage, Rabin, or a post-quantum SLH-DSA / WOTS+
  signature) that the in-process oracle cannot synthesise from plain args.
  This cause also records PROVENANCE: it marks exactly the entries that used to
  live in `crypto-exempt.json`, so the pre-merge partition stays recoverable.
  A handful of them (`all-readonly-cleanstack`, `covenant-vault`,
  `merkle-proof`, `state-covenant`) were historically filed there but read as
  `stateful-harness-gap` / `go-only`; the merge did NOT silently reclassify
  them. Reclassify deliberately, not as a side effect of another change.
- **`stateful-harness-gap`** — non-crypto: the SDK `call()` continuation path
  cannot reconstruct the exact tx shape a `StatefulSmartContract` method
  demands.
- **`go-only`** — `compilers:[go]` fixtures have no TypeScript codegen, so
  `compile()` cannot emit deployed bytes for the TS-based harness to run.
- **`interpreter-unsupported`** — the ANF interpreter does not model the
  intrinsic the fixture uses (today: the raw-script `asm` intrinsic).

Each entry's free-text `reason` is for humans only, and `cause` says only WHY
the plain oracle is out of the picture — neither is evidence. The MACHINE-CHECKED
truth of "what actually covers this fixture" lives in a structured `coveredBy`
field, verified by `coverage-claims.test.ts` — list membership alone is never
treated as coverage (this is the fix for a past bug where several entries
claimed "Covered by the Go tx-context path" / `script_execution_test.go`
without that file actually referencing the fixture). `coveredBy.kind` is one of:

- `"go-script-exec"` — the fixture's exact name is compiled and executed by
  `conformance/script_execution_test.go` (`compileRúnar("<fixture>", ...)`).
  Verified by grepping that literal call.
- `"go-family-exec"` — the fixture's underlying primitive (not the literal
  fixture contract) is exercised by a real Go test function
  (`coveredBy.marker`, e.g. `"TestSha256Compress_"`) in
  `script_execution_test.go`, via an inline reconstruction of the same
  codegen — real execution, but not of this exact fixture's bytes.
- `"integration"` — an on-chain regtest integration test (`coveredBy.path`
  under `integration/<tier>/`) deploys and spends the fixture's actual
  `.runar.ts` source. Verified by checking the file exists and references the
  fixture name.
- `"interpreter-witness-exec"` — the ANF interpreter (TS tier only) executes
  the fixture with realistic tx-context witness bytes injected via
  `TestContract.setPrevOutScript` / `setSerialisedOutputs` /
  `setMockPreimageBytes` (`coveredBy.path`). Real execution of the desugared
  intrinsics, but not full Bitcoin Script bytes.
- `"anf-cross-tier-parity"` — `conformance/anf-interpreter/cross-interpreter.test.ts`
  runs the fixture's method through the ANF interpreter across all 7 tiers
  (TS reference + per-language drivers under `conformance/anf-interpreter/drivers/`)
  and asserts the resulting state/outputs match a pinned golden
  (`coveredBy.input` names the `conformance/anf-interpreter/inputs/<file>.json`
  case). Proves cross-tier interpreter correctness; it is a DIFFERENT
  guarantee than the source-vs-script differential above (it does not compare
  against compiled Bitcoin Script bytes and has no accept/reject witness
  concept), so it is called out as its own kind rather than folded into
  `interpreter-witness-exec`.
- `"codegen-golden"` — byte-golden only, NOT executed by any engine. An honest
  opt-out: requires the fixture's own `expected-script.hex` to exist and,
  where a family has one, its dedicated codegen module
  (`packages/runar-compiler/src/passes/<family>-codegen.ts`) to exist.
- `"go-only-nocodegen"` — `compilers:["go"]` proof-system fixture; verified
  against the fixture's `source.json`.
- `"sdk-corner"` — an acknowledged SDK/harness limitation with no further
  machine-checkable evidence beyond a non-empty `reason`.
- `"UNCOVERED"` — genuinely unexecuted anywhere today. Requires a non-empty
  `issue` field describing the follow-up. `completeness.test.ts` does NOT
  count an `"UNCOVERED"` fixture as covered — the top-level completeness gate
  fails on it BY DESIGN, so a real coverage hole cannot hide behind list
  membership. No entry currently carries this kind (`asm-raw-script`, the last
  one that did, is now executed by `script_execution_test.go`); the kind stays
  supported so a future hole can be recorded honestly instead of dressed up.

## Why the other ledgers stay separate

`coverage-ledger.json` merged the only two files that were the same mechanism.
The repo has several other allowlist/ledger files. They look similar and are
NOT fragmentation — each answers a different question, has a different
lifecycle, and is enforced by a different gate. Do not fold them in:

- **`conformance/golden-provenance-allowlist.json`** — "was this changed golden
  file's new content reviewed?" Entries are sha256 content-pins plus a reviewer
  sign-off, and they go STALE the moment the golden legitimately changes. The
  coverage ledger pins no bytes and is expected to outlive individual goldens.
- **`conformance/fold-on-allowlist.json`** — the constant-folding parity axis:
  "this fixture's 7 tiers are allowed to disagree with fold ON." Nothing to do
  with whether an execution engine runs the fixture. Currently empty, and the
  right state for it is empty.
- **`conformance/sdk-output/coverage-allowlist.json`** — a different suite
  entirely (the 7-SDK deployed-locking-script comparison), prose-mapped rather
  than `coveredBy`-structured.
- **`conformance/source-map/anchor-known-issues.json`** — per-`(fixture, tier)`
  source-map anchor signatures. It is EMPTY and must stay empty; merging it
  into a populated file would hide that property.
- **`conformance/script-size-baseline.json`**, **`conformance/mutation/baseline.json`**
  — measurements, not exemptions. They record what IS, and a diff against them
  is the signal; they never assert that something is covered.
## Known architectural residual — non-executed goldens (deep-review C24)

Everything above makes coverage *claims* machine-checked. It does not make every
golden *executed*. Deep-review finding C24 names the leftover risk explicitly, and
this section is its acknowledgement rather than a fix, because closing it needs
capability the harness does not have (see "What would actually close it").

**The shape of the risk (the BUG-101 class).** A golden is produced by the very
implementation under test. Cross-tier parity proves the seven compilers *agree*;
it does not prove they are *right*. When no engine ever executes a fixture's
bytes, seven tiers can agree on a wrong answer indefinitely — which is exactly
what happened in BUG-101 (BLAKE3 was byte-identical across all tiers and wrong in
all of them, because nothing ever ran it against a KAT). "Parity-green-but-wrong"
is a real, observed failure mode in this repo, not a hypothetical.

**Current exposure — 6 fixtures** (was 15, then 8; see both corrections below).
Both categories are legitimate opt-outs, both are machine-verified as *claims*
by `coverage-claims.test.ts`, and neither is execution. **The count is no longer
prose:** `completeness.test.ts` pins it against `MAX_UNEXECUTED_GOLDENS` and
requires every member to carry a dated `closePlan` (plan Phase G1/G3), because
this paragraph said 15 while the truth was 8 for months.

- `codegen-golden` (5) — byte-golden only, executed by no engine:
  `ec-unit`, `p256-primitives`, `p256-wallet`, `p384-primitives`,
  `p384-wallet`.
  EC / NIST-P verification scripts. Their PRIMITIVES are covered elsewhere
  (`real-crypto/`, the Go `go-family-exec` markers, KAT vector tests) — it is
  these fixtures' own composed bytes that nothing runs. The reason differs per
  family and is recorded per entry in `coverage-ledger.json` under `closePlan`:
  - `ec-unit` is **blocked on a confirmed open codegen bug**, not on harness
    capability. `testOps()` takes no arguments and needs no witness, so it was
    spent on a live regtest node and **rejected** — `ecMul(g, 2n)` returns an
    all-zero point (the Jacobian ladder cannot double when the accumulator
    equals the point being added). Fix that in all seven tiers first; adding a
    stronger label now would freeze a known-unspendable script as correct.
  - `p256-primitives` / `p384-primitives` are **blocked on the same two codegen
    bugs as `ec-unit`**, confirmed 2026-08-06 by executing the emitted script
    through `@bsv/sdk`'s `Spend`: `p256Add(G, G)` / `p384Add(G, G)` return the
    wrong point (`cAffineAdd` in `p256-p384-codegen.ts` still implements ONLY
    the chord slope — the tangent-select fix commit `8a6494b4` applied to
    secp256k1 `affineAdd` was never ported to the NIST-P curves), and
    `p256Mul(G, 2n)` / `p384Mul(G, 2n)` return an all-zero point. `k = 3n` is
    correct in both, pinning the blob format. `verifyAdd(a, b)` exercises the
    first defect and `verify(k, basePoint)` the second, so a witness written
    today would go red for the codegen, not for the harness.
    Two further notes. They need **no signature at all** — `verify` /
    `verifyAdd` / `verifyMulGen` take plain scalars and points — so the
    `crypto-witness-infeasible` cause reads false on its own wording, and what
    actually blocks the plain differential oracle is that the ANF interpreter
    MOCKS `p256Add` / `p256Mul` / `p256MulGen` (64 zero bytes) and
    `p256OnCurve` (unconditionally `true`). The cause is nonetheless left
    unchanged, deliberately: `crypto-witness-infeasible` carries provenance
    (see the cause vocabulary above), and the interpreter mock is removable, so
    `interpreter-unsupported` would go stale in turn. And beyond the bugs, an
    EXTERNAL curve-arithmetic KAT is still missing:
    `runtime-vectors/ecdsa-rfc6979.json` holds P-256/P-384 *signature* vectors
    only, and `packages/runar-go/crypto_kat_test.go` feeds them to the native Go
    implementation, never to compiled script.
  - `p256-wallet` / `p384-wallet` do need a real NIST-P signature. Their
    integration tests genuinely only **deploy**, and the Go/TS regtest spends
    that exist run *inline* 2-parameter contracts, not these 4-parameter
    fixtures. Deploying does not execute a locking script.
- `go-only-nocodegen` (1) — `compilers:["go"]` proof-system fixture:
  `babybear-ext4`. Single-tier by project policy (see the EVM/STARK note in the
  root `CLAUDE.md`), so it has no cross-tier agreement signal at all — a Go-only
  bug in it has neither an execution check nor a parity check behind it.
  `conformance/script_execution_test.go` has no babybear test of any kind, even
  though `compileRúnar` + `executeScript` is exactly the pattern its 16
  `TestECPrimitives_*` functions already use.

**Correction (2026-08-06): the two post-quantum wallets ARE executed.**
`post-quantum-wallet` and `sphincs-wallet` were carried here as unexecuted, and
the sentence above used to read "the four `*-wallet` entries DO have integration
tests, but those only **deploy**". That was true of the two NIST-P wallets and
wrong about these two. `integration/go/wots_test.go` and
`integration/go/slhdsa_test.go` deploy **and spend** them on a live regtest
node: a real ECDSA signature over the real spending input, then a real WOTS+ /
SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s signature over those signature bytes, `AssertTxAccepted`, plus
two `AssertTxRejected` legs each. Each test compiles the fixture's own
`.runar.ts` source, and both compiles were verified byte-identical to the
fixtures' `expected-script.hex` (19,594 and 188,609 bytes, in *both* fold
modes), so the bytes the node executed are the fixtures' own bytes with only the
two constructor slots substituted. Both entries now carry
`kind: "integration"`. Scope worth knowing: the Go tier is the only one that
spends — the ts/python/rust/ruby/zig/java peer suites are deploy-only, and
`integration/README.md`'s "Deploy + Spend" row over-claims for those six.

**Correction (2026-08-03): seven fixtures were listed here that ARE executed.**
`babybear`, `convergence-proof`, `ec-demo`, `merkle-proof`, `oracle-price`,
`schnorr-zkp` and `state-covenant` are deployed AND SPENT on a live regtest node
by the Zig integration suite, most with reject cases alongside the accept. They
had been carried as unexecuted since before those tests existed. The claim was
not taken on trust: each fixture's `expected-script.hex` was compared against
the compiler output for the exact source the integration test compiles, and all
seven match byte-for-byte — so the bytes the node executed are the fixture's own
bytes. Two of them (`babybear`, `merkle-proof`) are `compilers:["go"]` fixtures
where the Zig port nonetheless reproduces the Go golden exactly. Their ledger
entries now carry `kind: "integration"` with the test path and that evidence.

**What is actually guaranteed today.** For the remaining 6: the bytes are stable
(a silent regeneration fails the golden-provenance gate), the fixture parses in
all seven frontends (the parser-only matrix ignores the `compilers` allowlist),
and for the 5 non-single-tier ones the seven compilers agree byte-for-byte.
That is meaningful but it is *consistency*, not *correctness*.

**What would actually close it.** Per family, one of: (a) an official KAT
executed against the compiled bytes (this is what fixed BUG-101 — SLH-DSA and
BLAKE3 now carry real KATs); (b) a real-crypto witness under
`witnesses/real-crypto/` once the harness can synthesise the needed signature or
proof; or (c) an on-chain regtest integration spend under `integration/`. Prefer
(a) — it is the only one that catches an all-tiers-agree-and-all-are-wrong bug,
because its expected values come from outside this codebase entirely.

**Do not "fix" this by relabelling.** Moving a fixture from `codegen-golden` to a
stronger-sounding `coveredBy.kind` without adding real execution makes the gate
report better coverage than exists — the precise over-claim
`coverage-claims.test.ts` was written to prevent. The bar an upgrade must clear
is the one the 2026-08-03 and 2026-08-06 corrections above both met: name the
test, and verify the compiled bytes of the source that test actually runs are
byte-identical to the fixture's `expected-script.hex`. Without that byte match
the executed script is *some* script, not *this fixture's* script.

**And do not fix it by deleting the residual.** `completeness.test.ts` enforces
two things about this set (plan Phase G1/G3), so neither the count nor the
follow-up can drift back into prose:

- `MAX_UNEXECUTED_GOLDENS` is a committed ceiling held EQUAL to the current
  count, so the next `codegen-golden` / `go-only-nocodegen` entry fails CI —
  including one that appears by *downgrading* an existing execution claim.
  Lowering it is how a genuine close is recorded; raising it is a deliberate,
  argued diff.
- Every member must carry `closePlan: {date, plan}` with an ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`
  date and a non-empty plan. "Soon" does not parse. Both gates carry RED-PROOFs
  in the same file.
